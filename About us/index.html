We have a diverse client base to whom we supply mated Italian queens every season. Weâ€™re not just for the big commercial apiaries but are also happy to help out smaller scale beekeepers with their requeening and often provide advice.</p><p>The company has no minimum order amount and no maximum (with enough notice!). We believe that our bees are fairly priced and by publishing our prices we remain transparent. Our price is the same regardless of quantity whether the order is for 1 or 1000. The only difference is that the courier price will be higher per queen for smaller orders</p></p></header><p>Le body</p></article><script src="../js/script.main-7e897aa2.js"></script></body></html>
