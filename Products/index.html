They are available from October to April. These queens are laying at time of despatch. They are caged with escort bees and couriered using overnight delivery anywhere in New Zealand.</p><p>Queen cells are ready for collection when they are 10 days old. They should emerge between 11 and 13 days old. All going to plan with the weather and drone availability you should have a naturally mated queen three weeks from receiving your queen cell. Cells must be collected from our yard and you will need an incubator to transport them safely.</p><p>Virgin queens are a popular alternative to queen cells or mated queens. Because they are caged with escort bees, they are easier to transport than queen cells. We then deliver using courier services.</p><p>Instrumentally inseminated queens are not normally for sale but are used as part of our breeding programme. They ensure genetic variation and vigour and prevent inbreeding.</p><p>Nucleus hives and full box hives are available in limited numbers throughout the season.
