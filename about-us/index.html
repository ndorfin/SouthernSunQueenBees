We have a diverse client base to whom we supply mated Italian queens every season.</p><p>We’re not just for the big commercial apiaries but are also happy to help out smaller scale beekeepers with their requeening and often provide advice.</p></p></header><h2 id=a-little-history>A little history</h2><p>Southern Sun Queen Bees was established in the Horowhenua Region over 20 years ago. Over time the business has moved from a wide based company providing pollination services as far away as the Bay of Plenty, honey production, and queen bee production for local consumers as well as for export to Canada. In more recent times, the business has focussed largely on queen production and trying to meet the New Zealand demand for quality Italian mated queens.</p><h2 id=where-were-located>Where we’re located</h2><p>Our base is in beautiful Manakau, Horowhenua, which has a benign micro-climate with plentiful rainfall that makes it an important horticultural hinterland for Wellington and surrounds. The region is bordered by the Tararua Ranges and warm sunny coastal plains.</p><h2 id=how-we-work>How we work</h2><p>Southern Sun Queen Bees has no minimum order amount and no maximum (with enough notice!). We believe that our bees are fairly priced and by publishing our prices we remain transparent. Our price is the same regardless of quantity whether the order is for 1 or 1000. The only difference is that the courier price will be higher per queen for smaller orders.</p><p>We have proven experience in producing quality Italian queens and we understand the requirements of beekeepers, whether they are large scale commercial or small scale hobbyists.</p><p>Southern Sun Queen Bees takes orders pre-season for over-wintered queens, as well as in-season sales of mated queens, virgin queens, queen cells and nucleus hives.</p><p>We believe it is essential to have hives with large numbers of bees for maximum honey crop returns and so we consider this to be the most important characteristic of our bees.</p><p>Our breeder queens are selected for brood and honey production.</p><p>While no one has yet developed a varroa resistant bee, degrees of hygienic behaviour can be achieved. We are improving our breeder selection processes to strengthen the hygienic behaviour of our bees.</p><p>Aggressive bees do not produce more honey and we focus on breeding bees that have a mild temperament and are easy to handle.</p><p>Italian bees can range in colour from golden yellow to brown.</p><p>Occasionally Italian bees can also have a black tip or light striping of the abdomen. Colour is the least important selection criteria so there will be variations in our queens.</p></article><script src="../js/script.main-7e897aa2.js"></script></body></html>
